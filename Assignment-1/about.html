            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Anmol Saini, a dedicated and curious BCA student from Pathankot, Punjab, currently pursuing my
                second semester at Aman Bhalla Group of Institutes. Ever since I began my journey in the field of
                technology, I've been passionate about exploring how digital products are built and how design and
                functionality come together to create powerful user experiences. My academic background, paired with
                hands-on learning, has helped me build a solid foundation in web development and user interface design.
            </p>

            <h3>What I Do</h3>
            <p>
                I recently completed a UI/UX design internship at TinkerChild, where I was responsible for redesigning
                seven major pages of an educational website focused on UPSC CSE preparation. This experience gave me
                real-world exposure to design thinking, user flows, and visual hierarchy. In parallel, I'm part of the
                IIT Connect Summer School Program by Techible, where I am learning full stack web development. Through
                this, I've been working on improving my skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, while
                understanding the broader workflow of modern web applications.
