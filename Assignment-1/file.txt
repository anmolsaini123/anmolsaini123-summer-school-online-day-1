1. What Each HTML Element Does:

Below is a list of HTML5 elements used in my enhanced form and layout, with a short explanation for each:

Page Structure Elements (Semantic HTML5)

<html>: The root element of every HTML document.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the document (like title, charset).
<title>: Sets the title of the webpage that appears on the browser tab.
<body>: Holds all the visible content on the webpage.
<header>: Represents the top section of the webpage. Typically includes a title/logo and navigation.
<nav>: Contains navigation links for easy movement between sections/pages.
<main>: Represents the main content of the page, excluding sidebars or repetitive content.
<section>: Defines a section within the page, such as the contact form area.
<article> (optional): Used for standalone content (not used in this project, but relevant).
<footer>: The bottom part of the page, includes copyright and external links.

Form Elements:

<form>: Used to collect user input and submit data to a server or script.
<label>: Associates a text label with an input field for better accessibility.

<input>: Accepts user input. Used in different types:
type="text": For plain text (e.g., Name)
type="email": Ensures the user enters a valid email format
type="tel": For phone numbers; helps mobile users with number keyboard
type="date": Allows users to select a date using a calendar
type="range": Lets users pick a number within a defined range using a slider
type="checkbox": Allows users to select multiple options (like contact methods)
type="radio": Lets users choose only one option from a group (like inquiry type)

<textarea>: Used for longer, multi-line text input (e.g., user messages)
<fieldset>: Groups related form elements together (like contact method or inquiry type)
<legend>: Provides a caption for a fieldset
<button>: Used to submit the form (can also be used for resetting or scripting)

Link Elements

<a href="">: Defines a hyperlink to another page or external site. Used for:
Internal links: href="index.html" (main page), href="portfolio.html" (projects)
External links: GitHub, LinkedIn, IIT Connect page

Text Formatting Elements

<h1>, <h2>, <h3>: Heading tags used for different content levels (h1 = most important)
<p>: Defines a paragraph of text for explanation or context
<br>: Line break used inside form labels for spacing

2. Why I Chose Specific Input Types

Each input type serves a clear purpose:

text: Used for general free-form input like name.
email: Helps ensure correct formatting (e.g., someone@example.com) using built-in validation.
tel: Designed for phone numbers; on mobile, it opens a numeric keypad.
date: Makes date selection user-friendly with a calendar UI.
range: Useful for numeric scales (e.g., budget from ₹10K–₹100K).
checkbox: Allows the user to select one or more preferred contact methods (Email, Phone, Text).
radio: Perfect for selecting a single option from multiple choices like inquiry type (General, Business, Support).
textarea: Lets users write a longer message or description with multiple lines.

3. How My Navigation Structure Works

The navigation bar is created using the <nav> element inside the <header>.

It includes <a> links for:
Internal navigation: about.html, portfolio.html, contact.html
External navigation: GitHub, LinkedIn, etc. (open in a new tab using target="_blank")
This allows users to easily move between different pages or sections of the website.
The nav is placed inside the <header> to make it appear on top and be accessible from every page.
External links are also added in the footer section.
